# My Personal Project: Smart Fridge

## What will this application do:

Smart Fridge enables users to
- add footItem into FoodItem list with foodItem name, purchase date, and it's expiry date
- Mark the foodItem in the FoodItem as Used or Out Of Stock
- add the foodItem which users want to buy into Shopping item list
- View the Expiry FoodItem in user's FoodItem List

Basically, user add what they have in FoodItem list, and SmartFridge will store the data, and also
check the Fooditem is expired or not.
User can also add what the want to buy in ShoppingItem list, and SmartFridge will store the data so the user
can be reminded when they're shopping.


## Who will use this?:
Everyone who's into cooking or buying food from outside

## Why this project interest you?:
Because I waste tons of food due to the unawareness of expiry date, 
so I want to build a helper for myself to track my FoodItem, also I always forgot
what I need to buy, so I want to build a shoppingItem list for myself to remind me to 
buy all the foodItem in the list
